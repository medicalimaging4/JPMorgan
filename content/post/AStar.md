## Accelerate Technologies ETC/EBC/D3 is a drug discovery and development research institute that is funded by the Singapore government. Our mission is to shape the future of therapeutics healthcare by developing new medicines for diseases with huge unmet medical need through a scientific, data driven process in line with pharma industry standards. We are a central hub for biomedical R&amp;D in Singapore and South-East Asia, and our pipeline of innovative novel targets is sourced from academia and industry globally.  We have fully integrated drug and biomarker discovery capabilities to progress projects from target validation through to early clinical development to achieve proof of concept in human.  Our assets are then licensed to industry or spun out for further development and commercialization.
